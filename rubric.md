# Projects

Students will complete the class projects in teams of 2 to 3. If you have a reason why you would like to
work alone, you need to talk to a TA to get it approved. For projects requiring use of a lab computer, a
machine will be assigned to each team. Each project submission should consist of a **README**, a
**Makefile**, and the project **source code** (*binaries and executables should be removed*) **tar’ed** into a single
file. Tar files are to be submitted electronically **via Canvas**. Each team is to submit only one copy of the
project with the name

**project<n>_lastname1_lastname2_lastname3.tar**
*where n corresponds to the nth project.*

## Project Grading Policy

Each project will be graded out of 100 points. Partial credit will be given for incomplete efforts.
However, a program that cannot compile cannot get more than 30 points.

- Project implementation 70 pts
- Documentation 30 pts
- Submission 4 pts
- Named correctly and includes all relevant files 2 pts
- Doesn’t include binaries or executables 2 pts
- README 10 pts
- File listing 5 pts
- Makefile description 5 pts
- Documentation of Group Member Contribution 6 pts
- Division of Labor (can be put in README) 3 pts
- GIT Commit Log 3 pts
- Coding style 10 pts
- Variable/functions names indicate purpose with appropriate comments 3 pts
- Readability (indentation, white space, max column-width < 100 chars) 3 pts
- Submission does not contain unnecessary print statements 4 pts

**If the project solution does not use the Makefile mechanism or compile as specified in the README,
70 points will be deduced from the total project grade.** It is the student's responsibility to make sure that
the solution archive will un-tar correctly. Please test your instructions in the README file as if you are
the grader prior to submitting them. For projects 1 and 3, grading will be completed on linprog. It is
recommended that you develop these projects on linprog as it is your responsibility to ensure your
program compiles and runs correctly on linprog.

## README
Your README file will need to contain the following in a nicely formatted text file.

- The project team members' names and division of labor
- List who worked on each part of the project
- The contents of your tar archive and a brief description of each file
- How to compile your executables using your Makefile
- Known bugs and unfinished portions of the project
- Special considerations or anything I should know when grading your solution
- Any completed extra credit must be documented in the README to receive credit

## Bugs

Your README will contain a list of all known bugs in your program. For each bug, include a brief
description of when it is occurring (compile, link, or runtime), when the bug first showed up, the
symptoms the bug is giving off, and how you attempted to fix it. Undocumented bugs will incur a
greater penalty.

Demonstrating that you understand why a program has a bug, even if you are unsure of how to fix it,
shows that you are thorough. An undocumented bug shows that you do not understand the program, or
that you tried to hide a flaw. Undocumented bugs only slow down future development.

## GIT Commit Log

- Submit a screenshot of the commits made to the repository
- All groups must use a private GIT repository
- All group members must actively commit his/her contributions to the repository
- If the commit log / division of labor indicates a group member does not contribute equally,
deductions will be made for that group member
